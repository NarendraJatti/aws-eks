pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Set kubeconfig') {
            steps {
                withCredentials([string(credentialsId: 'kubeconfig_secret', variable: 'KUBECONFIG')]) {
                    sh 'echo "$KUBECONFIG" > $HOME/.kube/config'
                    sh 'kubectl get ns'
                }
            }
        }
    }
