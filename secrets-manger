In the case of using Secrets Store CSI Driver with AWS Secrets Manager, the secrets are not automatically updated in the pod when the secret is updated in AWS Secrets Manager. By default, the Secrets Store CSI driver fetches the secrets at the time of pod creation, and changes to the secrets will not be automatically reflected in the pod's mounted volume.

Options to Update Secrets:
1)Restart the Pod: 
kubectl delete pod test-secret-pod
kubectl apply -f pod-secret.yaml
2)Enable Automatic Rotation: If you need the secrets to automatically update in the pod when the secret in Secrets Manager changes, you'll need to enable secret rotation.

For AWS Secrets Store CSI Driver, you can configure automatic secret rotation by integrating it with AWS Secrets Manager rotation. Youâ€™ll need to:

Enable secret rotation in AWS Secrets Manager for the specific secret.
Implement the required configuration to refresh the pod or trigger redeployment when the secret changes.
3)Manual Update of the Mounted Volume: Alternatively, you can force Kubernetes to remount the volume by manually deleting the pod and letting it be recreated. You can also automate this process using tools like Kubernetes controllers to redeploy the pod when secrets change.


Install AWS Secrets Store CSI Driver in EKS
Step 1: Add the Helm chart repository
Step 2: Install the Secrets Store CSI driver in EKS
Step 3: Install the AWS provider for the Secrets Store CSI Driver

important>irsa> You need to associate an IAM role with the Kubernetes service account (in this case, the default service account) to give the pod permissions to retrieve secrets from Secrets Manager.

Create a Secret in AWS Secrets Manager
aws secretsmanager create-secret --name my-secret --secret-string '{"username":"admin"}'

A SecretProviderClass defines how the CSI driver should retrieve secrets from AWS Secrets Manager.
apiVersion: secrets-store.csi.x-k8s.io/v1
kind: SecretProviderClass
metadata:
  name: aws-secrets
  namespace: default
spec:
  provider: aws
  parameters:
    objects: |
      - objectName: "my-secret"
        objectType: "secretsmanager"



In Kubernetes, there's no direct command to "restart" a pod, but there are different ways to achieve a restart depending on how your pod is managed:
1. Pods Managed by a Deployment or ReplicaSet:
Method: Rolling Restart

You can restart all the pods in a Deployment (or ReplicaSet) by updating the deployment, which triggers a rolling restart.
To restart the pods, run:

kubectl rollout restart deployment <deployment-name>
This will gracefully terminate the old pods and create new ones.

ethod: Scaling the Deployment

You can scale down and scale up your deployment to effectively restart all the pods:

kubectl scale deployment <deployment-name> --replicas=0
kubectl scale deployment <deployment-name> --replicas=<desired-replicas>

tandalone Pods:
For standalone pods (not managed by Deployments, ReplicaSets, etc.), there's no direct restart mechanism.
You have to delete and recreate the pod.

kubectl delete pod <pod-name>
If the pod is standalone, it won't be automatically recreated unless you apply the pod YAML again or use the appropriate command.

Force Restart by Changing the Pod Spec:
You can trigger a pod restart by making a small change to the pod's definition (like adding an annotation). This change forces Kubernetes to recreate the pod.
kubectl annotate pod <pod-name> kubernetes.io/restartedAt="$(date +%s)" --overwrite
This won't restart the pod immediately but will cause Kubernetes to replace the pod with a new one.

Summary:
For managed pods (Deployment, ReplicaSet): Use kubectl rollout restart.
For standalone pods: You need to delete and manually recreate them.
